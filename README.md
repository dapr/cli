The Dapr CLI allows you to setup Dapr on your local dev machine or on a Kubernetes cluster, provides debugging support, launches and manages Dapr instances.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

On default, during initialization the Dapr CLI will install the Dapr binaries as well as setup a developer environment to help you get started easily with Dapr. This environment uses Docker containers, therefore Docker needs to be installed. If you prefer to run Dapr without this environment and no dependency on Docker, after installation of the CLI make sure to follow the instructions to initialize Dapr using [slim init](#slim-init).

Note, if you are a new user, it is strongly recommended to install Docker and use the regular init command.

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

>__Note: On Windows, Docker must be running in Linux Containers mode__

### Installing Dapr CLI

#### Using script to install the latest release

**Windows**

Install the latest windows Dapr CLI to `$Env:SystemDrive\dapr` and add this directory to User PATH environment variable. Use `-DaprRoot [path]` to change the default installation directory

```powershell
powershell -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Linux**

Install the latest linux Dapr CLI to `/usr/local/bin`

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash
```

**MacOS**

Install the latest darwin Dapr CLI to `/usr/local/bin`

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

#### From the Binary Releases

Each release of Dapr CLI includes various OSes and architectures. These binary versions can be manually downloaded and installed.

1. Download the [Dapr CLI](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases)
2. Unpack it (e.g. dapr_linux_amd64.tar.gz, dapr_windows_amd64.zip)
3. Move it to your desired location.
   * For Linux/MacOS - `/usr/local/bin`
   * For Windows, create a directory and add this to your System PATH. For example create a directory called `c:\dapr` and add this directory to your path, by editing your system environment variable.

#### From the MSI Package (windows)

Install windows Dapr CLI using MSI package.

1. Download the [MSI Package](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases)
2. Run `dapr.msi` to install Dapr CLI on your system

> NOTE: The default installation directory is set to `$Env:SystemDrive\dapr` and can be modified at the time of installation.

### Install Dapr on your local machine (self-hosted)

In self-hosted mode, dapr can be initialized using the CLI  with the placement, scheduler, redis, and zipkin containers enabled by default(recommended) or without them which also does not require docker to be available in the environment.

#### Initialize Dapr

([Prerequisite](#Prerequisites): Docker is available in the environment - recommended)

Use the init command to initialize Dapr. On init, multiple default configuration files and containers are installed along with the dapr runtime binary. Dapr runtime binary is installed under $HOME/.dapr/bin for Mac, Linux and %USERPROFILE%\.dapr\bin for Windows.

```bash
dapr init
```

> For Linux users, if you run your docker cmds with sudo, you need to use "**sudo dapr init**"

Output should look like so:

```
⌛  Making the jump to hyperspace...
✅  Downloaded binaries and completed components set up.
ℹ️  daprd binary has been installed to  $HOME/.dapr/bin.
ℹ️  dapr_placement container is running.
ℹ️  dapr_scheduler container is running.
ℹ️  dapr_redis container is running.
ℹ️  dapr_zipkin container is running.
ℹ️  Use `docker ps` to check running containers.
✅  Success! Dapr is up and running. To get started, go here: https://aka.ms/dapr-getting-started
```

> Note: To see that Dapr has been installed successfully, from a command prompt run the `docker ps` command and check that the `daprio/dapr:latest`,  `dapr_redis` and `dapr_zipkin` container images are all running.

This step creates the following defaults:

1. components folder which is later used during `dapr run` unless the `--resources-path` (`--components-path` is deprecated and will be removed in future releases) option is provided. For Linux/MacOS, the default components folder path is `$HOME/.dapr/components` and for Windows it is `%USERPROFILE%\.dapr\components`.
2. component files in the components folder called `pubsub.yaml` and `statestore.yaml`.
3. default config file `$HOME/.dapr/config.yaml` for Linux/MacOS or for Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\.dapr\config.yaml` to enable tracing on `dapr init` call. Can be overridden with the `--config` flag on `dapr run`.

#### Slim Init

Alternatively to the above, to have the CLI not install any default configuration files or run Docker containers, use the `--slim` flag with the init command. Only Dapr binaries will be installed.

```bash
dapr init --slim
```

Output should look like so:

```bash
⌛  Making the jump to hyperspace...
✅  Downloaded binaries and completed components set up.
ℹ️  daprd binary has been installed to $HOME/.dapr/bin.
ℹ️  placement binary has been installed.
ℹ️  scheduler binary has been installed.
✅  Success! Dapr is up and running. To get started, go here: https://aka.ms/dapr-getting-started
```

>Note: When initializing Dapr with the `--slim` flag only the Dapr runtime, placement, and scheduler service binaries are installed. An empty default components folder is created with no default configuration files. During `dapr run` user should use `--resources-path` (`--components-path` is deprecated and will be removed in future releases) to point to a components directory with custom configurations files or alternatively place these files in the default directory. For Linux/MacOS, the default components directory path is `$HOME/.dapr/components` and for Windows it is `%USERPROFILE%\.dapr\components`.

#### Install a specific runtime version

You can install or upgrade to a specific version of the Dapr runtime using `dapr init --runtime-version`. You can find the list of versions in [Dapr Release](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases).

```bash
# Install v1.0.0 runtime
dapr init --runtime-version 1.0.0

# Check the versions of CLI and runtime
dapr --version
CLI version: v1.0.0
Runtime version: v1.0.0
```

#### Install with mariner images

You can install Dapr Runtime using mariner images using the `--image-variant` flag. 

```bash
# Installing Dapr with Mariner images
dapr init --image-variant mariner
```

#### Install by providing a docker container registry url

You can install Dapr runtime by pulling docker images from a given private registry uri by using `--image-registry` flag.
> Note: This command expects that images have been hosted like example.io/<username>/dapr/dapr:<tag>, example.io/<username>/dapr/3rdparty/redis:<tag>, example.io/<username>/dapr/3rdparty/zipkin:<tag>

```bash
# Example of pulling images from a private registry.
dapr init --image-registry example.io/<username>
```

#### Install in airgap environment

You can install Dapr runtime in airgap (offline) environment using a pre-downloaded [installer bundle](https://github.com/dapr/installer-bundle/releases). You need to download the archived bundle for your OS beforehand (e.g., daprbundle_linux_amd64.tar.gz,) and unpack it. Thereafter use the local Dapr CLI binary in the bundle with `--from-dir` flag in the init command to point to the extracted bundle location to initialize Dapr.

Move to the bundle directory and run the following command:

```bash
# Initializing dapr in airgap environment
./dapr init --from-dir .
```

> For windows, use `.\dapr.exe` to point to the local Dapr CLI binary.

> If you are not running the above command from the bundle directory, provide the full path to bundle directory as input. For example, assuming the bundle directory path is $HOME/daprbundle, run `$HOME/daprbundle/dapr init --from-dir $HOME/daprbundle` to have the same behavior.

> Note: Dapr Installer bundle just contains the placement and scheduler containers apart from the binaries and so `zipkin` and `redis` are not enabled by default. You can pull the images locally either from network or private registry and run as follows:

```bash
docker run --name "dapr_zipkin" --restart always -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
docker run --name "dapr_redis" --restart always -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Alternatively to the above, you can also have slim installation as well to install dapr without running any Docker containers in airgap mode.   

```bash
./dapr init --slim --from-dir .
```

#### Install to a specific Docker network

You can install the Dapr runtime to a specific Docker network in order to isolate it from the local machine (e.g. to use Dapr from *within* a Docker container).

```bash
# Create Docker network
docker network create dapr-network

# Install Dapr to the network
dapr init --network dapr-network
```

> Note: When installed to a specific Docker network, you will need to add the `--placement-host-address` arguments to `dapr run` commands run in any containers within that network.
> The format of `--placement-host-address` argument is either `<hostname>` or `<hostname>:<port>`. If the port is omitted, the default port `6050` for Windows and `50005` for Linux/MacOS applies.

> Note: When installed to a specific Docker network, you will need to add the `--scheduler-host-address` arguments to `dapr run` commands run in any containers within that network.
> The format of `--scheduler-host-address` argument is either `<hostname>` or `<hostname>:<port>`. If the port is omitted, the default port `6060` for Windows and `50006` for Linux/MacOS applies.

#### Install with a specific container runtime

You can install the Dapr runtime using a specific container runtime
environment such as Docker or Podman by passing along the
`--container-runtime` argument:

```bash
# Install Dapr with Podman
$ dapr init --container-runtime podman
```

> Note: The default container runtime is Docker.

#### In a dev container or GitHub Codespace

To install the Dapr CLI in a dev container or GitHub Codespace, add the following to your `devcontainer.json` file:

```jsonc
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/dapr/cli/dapr-cli:0": {}
}
```

Restart your dev container or GitHub Codespace and run `dapr init` to initialize Dapr.

For more details, see the docs for dev containers with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_dev-container-features) and [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/configuring-dev-containers/adding-features-to-a-devcontainer-file).

### Uninstall Dapr in a standalone mode

Uninstalling will remove daprd binary along with the placement and scheduler containers (if installed with Docker or the placement and scheduler binaries if not).


```bash
dapr uninstall
```

> For Linux users, if you run your docker cmds with sudo, you need to use "**sudo dapr uninstall**" to remove the containers.

The command above won't remove the redis or zipkin containers by default in case you were using it for other purposes.  It will also not remove the default dapr folder that was created on `dapr init`. To remove all the containers (placement, scheduler, redis, zipkin) and also the default dapr folder created on init run:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

The above command can also be run when Dapr has been installed in a non-docker environment, it will only remove the installed binaries and the default dapr folder in that case.

> NB: The `dapr uninstall` command will always try to remove the placement and scheduler binaries/services and will throw an error is not able to.

**You should always run a `dapr uninstall` before running another `dapr init`.**

#### Uninstall Dapr from a specific Docker network

If previously installed to a specific Docker network, Dapr can be uninstalled with the `--network` argument:

```bash
dapr uninstall --network dapr-network
```

#### Uninstall Dapr from a specific container runtime

You can uninstall Dapr from a specific container runtime
environment by passing along the `--container-runtime` argument:

```bash
# Uninstall Dapr from Podman container runtime
$ dapr uninstall --container-runtime podman
```

### Install Dapr on Kubernetes

The init command will install Dapr to a Kubernetes cluster. For more advanced use cases, use our [Helm Chart](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tree/master/charts/dapr).

*Note: The default namespace is dapr-system. The installation will appear under the name `dapr` for Helm*

```bash
dapr init -k
```

Output should look like as follows:

```
⌛  Making the jump to hyperspace...
ℹ️  Note: To install Dapr using Helm, see here:  https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr/#install-with-helm-advanced

✅  Deploying the Dapr control plane to your cluster...
✅  Success! Dapr has been installed to namespace dapr-system. To verify, run "dapr status -k" in your terminal. To get started, go here: https://aka.ms/dapr-getting-started
```

#### Supplying Helm values

All available [Helm Chart values](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tree/master/charts/dapr#configuration) can be set by using the `--set` flag:

```bash
dapr init -k --set global.tag=1.0.0 --set dapr_operator.logLevel=error  
```

#### Installing to a custom namespace

```bash
dapr init -k -n my-namespace
```

#### Installing with a highly available control plane config

```bash
dapr init -k --enable-ha=true
```

#### Installing with mTLS disabled

```bash
dapr init -k --enable-mtls=false
```

#### Waiting for the Helm install to complete (default timeout is 300s/5m)

```bash
dapr init -k --wait --timeout 600
```

#### Uninstall Dapr on Kubernetes

To remove Dapr from your Kubernetes cluster, use the `uninstall` command with `--kubernetes` flag or the `-k` shorthand.

```bash
dapr uninstall -k
```

The default timeout is 300s/5m and can be overridden using the `--timeout` flag.

```bash
dapr uninstall -k --timeout 600
```

To remove all Dapr Custom Resource Definitions:

```bash
dapr uninstall -k --all
```

*Warning: this will remove any components, subscriptions or configurations that are applied in the cluster at the time of deletion.*

### Upgrade Dapr on Kubernetes

To perform a zero downtime upgrade of the Dapr control plane:

```bash
dapr upgrade -k --runtime-version=1.0.0
```

The example above shows how to upgrade from your current version to version `1.0.0`.

*Note: `dapr upgrade` will retry up to 5 times upon failure*

#### Supplying Helm values

All available [Helm Chart values](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tree/master/charts/dapr#configuration) can be set by using the `--set` flag:

```bash
dapr upgrade -k --runtime-version=1.0.0 --set global.tag=my-tag --set dapr_operator.logLevel=error  
```

*Note: do not use the `dapr upgrade` command if you're upgrading from 0.x versions of Dapr*

### Use Private Helm Repository

export DAPR_HELM_REPO_URL="https://helmchart-repo.xxx.xxx/dapr/dapr"
export DAPR_HELM_REPO_USERNAME="username_xxx"
export DAPR_HELM_REPO_PASSWORD="passwd_xxx"

Setting the above parameters will allow `dapr init -k` to install Dapr images from the configured Helm repository.

### Launch Dapr and your app

The Dapr CLI lets you debug easily by launching both Dapr and your app.
Logs from both the Dapr Runtime and your app will be displayed in real time!

Example of launching Dapr with a node app:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp node app.js
```

Example of launching Dapr with a node app listening on port 3000:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js
```

Example of launching Dapr on HTTP port 6000:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 --dapr-http-port 6000 node app.js
```

Example of launching Dapr on gRPC port 50002:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 --dapr-grpc-port 50002 node app.js
```

Example of launching Dapr within a specific Docker network:

```bash
dapr init --network dapr-network
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --placement-host-address dapr_placement node app.js
```

> Note: When in a specific Docker network, the Redis, Zipkin and placement and scheduler service containers are given specific network aliases, `dapr_redis`, `dapr_zipkin`, `dapr_placement`, and `dapr_scheduler`, respectively. The default configuration files reflect the network alias rather than `localhost` when a docker network is specified.

### Use gRPC

If your app uses gRPC instead of HTTP to receive Dapr events, run the CLI with the following command:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-protocol grpc --app-port 6000 node app.js
```

The example above assumed your app port is 6000.

### Publish/Subscribe

To use pub-sub with your app, make sure that your app has a ```POST``` HTTP endpoint with some name, say ```myevent```.
This sample assumes your app is listening on port 3000.

Launch Dapr and your app:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js
```

Publish a message:

The `--pubsub` parameter takes in the name of the pub/sub.  The default name of the pub/sub configed by the CLI is "pubsub".


Publish a message:

* Linux/Mac

```bash
dapr publish --publish-app-id nodeapp --pubsub pubsub --topic myevent --data '{ "name": "yoda" }'
```

* Windows

```powershell
dapr publish --publish-app-id nodeapp --pubsub pubsub --topic myevent --data "{ \"name\": \"yoda\" }"
```

### Invoking

To test your endpoints with Dapr, simply expose any HTTP endpoint.
For this sample, we'll assume a node app listening on port 3000 with a ```/mymethod``` endpoint.

Launch Dapr and your app:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js
```

Note: To choose a non-default components folder, use the --resources-path(--components-path is deprecated) option.

Invoke your app:

```bash
dapr invoke --app-id nodeapp --method mymethod
```

Specify a verb:

By default, Dapr will use the `POST` verb. If your app uses Dapr for gRPC, you should use `POST`.

```bash
dapr invoke --app-id nodeapp --method mymethod --verb GET
```

### List

To list all Dapr instances running on your machine:

```bash
dapr list
```

To list all Dapr instances running in a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
dapr list --kubernetes
```

To list all Dapr instances but return output as JSON or YAML (e.g. for consumption by other tools):

```bash
dapr list --output json
dapr list --output yaml
```

### Check system services (control plane) status

Check Dapr's system services (control plane) health status in a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
dapr status --kubernetes
```

### Check mTLS status

To check if Mutual TLS is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
dapr mtls --kubernetes
```

### Export TLS certificates

To export the root cert, issuer cert and issuer key created by Dapr from a Kubernetes cluster to a local path:

```bash
dapr mtls export
```

This will save the certs to the working directory.

To specify a custom directory:

```bash
dapr mtls export -o certs
```

### Check root certificate expiry

```bash
dapr mtls expiry
```

This can be used when upgrading to a newer version of Dapr, as it's recommended to carry over the existing certs for a zero downtime upgrade.

### Renew Dapr certificates of a kubernetes cluster with one of the 3 ways mentioned below:
Renew certificate by generating new root and issuer certificates

```bash
dapr mtls renew-certificate -k --valid-until <no of days> --restart
```
Use existing private root.key to generate new root and issuer certificates

```bash
dapr mtls renew-certificate -k --private-key myprivatekey.key --valid-until <no of days>
```
Use user provided ca.crt, issuer.crt and issuer.key

```bash
dapr mtls renew-certificate -k --ca-root-certificate <ca.crt> --issuer-private-key <issuer.key> --issuer-public-certificate <issuer.crt> --restart
```
#### To view the complete list of flags and their combination, run below command:
```bash
dapr mtls renew-certificate -h
```

### List Components

To list all Dapr components on Kubernetes:

```bash
dapr components --kubernetes --all-namespaces
```

To list Dapr components in `target-namespace` namespace on Kubernetes:

```bash
dapr components --kubernetes --namespace target-namespace
```

### Use non-default Components Path

To use a custom path for component definitions

```bash
dapr run --resources-path [custom path]
> Note: --components-path flag is deprecated. It will continue to work until it is removed completely.
```


### List Configurations

To list all Dapr configurations on Kubernetes:

```bash
dapr configurations --kubernetes --all-namespaces
```

To list Dapr configurations in `target-namespace` namespace on Kubernetes:

```bash
dapr configurations --kubernetes --namespace target-namespace
```

### Stop

Use ```dapr list``` to get a list of all running instances.
To stop a Dapr app on your machine:

```bash
dapr stop myAppID
```

You can also stop multiple Dapr apps

```bash
dapr stop myAppID1 myAppID2
```

### Enable profiling

In order to enable profiling, use the `enable-profiling` flag:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js --enable-profiling
```

Dapr will automatically assign a profile port for you.
If you want to manually assign a profiling port, use the `profile-port` flag:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js --enable-profiling --profile-port 7777
```

### Set metrics server port

To change the metrics server port used by Dapr, set the `metrics-port` flag:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js --metrics-port 5040
```

### Set log level

In order to set the Dapr runtime log verbosity level, use the `log-level` flag:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js --log-level debug
```

This sets the Dapr log level to `debug`.
The default is `info`.

### Enable SSL when invoking an app

If your app is listening on `https` or has a gRPC TLS configuration enabled, use the following `app-ssl` flag:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js --app-ssl
```

This will have Dapr invoke the app over an insecure SSL channel.

The default is false.

### Running sidecar only

You can run Dapr's sidecar only (`daprd`) by omitting the application's command in the end:

```bash
dapr run --app-id myapp --dapr-http-port 3005 --dapr-grpc-port 50001
```

### Generate shell completion scripts

To generate shell completion scripts:

```bash
dapr completion
```

### Enable Unix domain socket

In order to enable Unix domain socket to connect Dapr API server, use the `--unix-domain-socket` flag:

```
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --unix-domain-socket node app.js
```

Dapr will automatically create a Unix domain socket to connect Dapr API server.

If you want to invoke your app, also use this flag:

```
dapr invoke --app-id nodeapp --unix-domain-socket --method mymethod
```

### Set API log level

In order to set the Dapr runtime to log API calls with `INFO` log verbosity, use the `enable-api-logging` flag:

```bash
dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js enable-api-logging
```

The default is `false`.

For more details, please run the command and check the examples to apply to your shell.

### Apply Dapr annotations

To add or modify dapr annotations on an existing Kubernetes manifest, use the `dapr annotate` command:

```bash
dapr annotate [flags] mydeployment.yaml
```

This will add the `dapr.io/enabled` and the `dapr.io/app-id` annotations. The dapr app id will be genereated using the format `<namespace>-<kind>-<name>` where the values are taken from the existing Kubernetes object metadata.

> NOTE: The annotate command currently only supports annotating Kubernetes manifests. You must provide the `-k` flag to target Kubernetes.

To provide your own dapr app id, provide the flag `--app-id`.

All dapr annotations are available to set if a value is provided for the appropriate flag on the `dapr annotate` command.

You can also provide the Kubernetes manifest via stdin:

```bash
kubectl get deploy mydeploy -o yaml | dapr annotate -k - | kubectl apply -f -
```

Or you can provide the Kubernetes manifest via a URL:

```bash
dapr annotate -k --log-level debug https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/quickstarts/master/tutorials/hello-kubernetes/deploy/node.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

If the input contains multiple manifests then the command will search for the first appropriate one to apply the annotations. If you'd rather it applied to a specific manifest then you can provide the `--resource` flag with the value set to the name of the object you'd like to apply the annotations to. If you have a conflict between namespaces you can also provide the namespace via the `--namespace` flag to isolate the manifest you wish to target.

If you want to annotate multiple manifests, you can chain together the `dapr annotate` commands with each applying the annotation to a specific manifest.

```bash
kubectl get deploy -o yaml | dapr annotate -k -r nodeapp --log-level debug - | dapr annotate -k --log-level debug -r pythonapp - | kubectl apply -f -
```
